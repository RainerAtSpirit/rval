# Getting started with RVal

The core of `RVal` is four functions which have all a very simple contract: `val`, `drv`, `sub` and `act`. 
Yes, they all have three-letter names. That's kind of cool I think. Not sure yet why.

## Creating reactive values using `val(initialValue)`

In RVal, the universe revolves around _reactive values_. 
Creating your first reactive value is easy:

```javascript
import { val } from "rval";

const myLuckyNumber = val(13)
```

`val` returns a function that returns any value you've put into it. 
So `myLuckyNumber` is now a number and we can call it:

```javascript
console.log(myLuckyNumber())
// prints: 13
```

Fancy! But what use is it to create a function that just returns the original value?
We'll find out in a bit. 
First, there is another trick the function can do: We can call it with a new lucky number, 
since the `13` didn't work out after all:

```javascript
myLuckyNumber(42)

console.log(myLuckyNumber())
// prints: 42
``` 

By passing an argument to the function, we can update it's internal state.
When calling the reactive value function without argumens, it will always return the value we've passed into it the last time.

You can put any value you like into a reactive value. 
But, for all practical purposes, you've should consider this value to be immutable. 
This will greatly benefit the understanding of the code base once it grows big enough.
But, more on that later.

See the [Philosophy](docs-philosophy) for some more background on this idea.
