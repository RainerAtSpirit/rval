# About RVal

RVal is a minimalistic, transparent reactive programming library, heavily inspired by [MobX](http://mobx.js.org)[^1], 
with the same core principle: _Everything that can be derived from state, should be derived. Automatically_.

RVal enables you to organize state into **reactive values**, and provides utilities to **update** this state, **derive** from this state, and organize **side-effects** related to this state.

The core principles of RVal are:

* 🍭 **Minimalistic** A very simple, minimalistic core API
* 🛅 **Functions + stateful immutable objects**: Functions and (stateful) immutable objects as the primary means to organize state
* 🎯 **Convention driven**: An idiomatic way of working, that guides devs into the [Pit of Success](https://medium.com/@ricomariani/the-pit-of-success-cfefc6cb64c8)
* 📦 **Embeddable**: A low level building block, that is small (~2KB minified gzipped) so that it can easily be embedded in existing libraries and frameworks as state management library.
* 🐆 **Fast**: Rock solid performance, leveraging the battle tested algorithms of MobX.
* ☔ **Versatile**: no dependencies, no modern syntax or language requirements, non-intrusive, applicable in any ES5 JavaScript stack
* 🎓 **Gradual learning curve**: Opt-in utilities that help with applying best practices
* 💪 **Strongly typed**: Shouldn't need further explanation in 2019

Ok, that is a pretty vague, generic list of things that sound positive.
It boils down to this: RVal is small, conceptually simple and powerful.
Or, put differently: 

_The proof of the pudding is in the eating._.

Here are some terms that you will encounter when reading the introduction: 
It's all about _reactive values_ and _immutable stateful objects_. 
Read the introduction to find out what that abomination of seemingly conflicting concepts means.
But at least: you won't be needing `this`, `let`, `var` or `class`.
However, if you don't like messing around with functions, you'll better take refuge somewhere else.

## Quick example

Finally, some code! Here is quick example of RVal incombination with React:

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { val } from "@r-val/core"
import { rview } from "@r-val/react"

const counter = val(0)

const Counter = () => rview(() => (
    <>
        {counter()}
        <button onClick={() => counter(0)}>Reset</button>
    </>
))

setInterval(() => {
  counter(c => c + 1)
}, 1000)

render(<Counter />, document.body)
```

This example can be tried in [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/m297j6w38). Some quick highlights:
1. This application has a single _reactive value_, called `counter`, initialized to `0`.
2. The component is reading the current value, by calling `counter()`, that simply returns the current state.
3. The `onClick` handler replaces the internal state of the `counter` with the value `0` again.
4. The `setInterval` updates the `counter` every second, using a function that takes the current state of the `counter`, and produces a new state.
5. The [`rview`](#/introduction/react) function creates a _reactive view_, which takes a render callback, and re-render's automatically when any of the reactive values inside it's function body changes. That is why we see the counter actually ticking (Note that the `counter` is neither part of the state or props of the component). 

Hopefully this example will strike you as slightly boring. Good, this library wasn't build to write counters. 
The following example is slightly more elaborate. Or you can just jump ahead to all the [core concepts](#/introduction/the-basics).

## Philosophy

Interesting in the _why_ of RVal? In that case check out the [philosophy](#/introduction/philosophy) section.

[^1]: Compared to Mobx, the goals are slightly different and the library is in terms of API surface and bundle size _much_ smaller.
