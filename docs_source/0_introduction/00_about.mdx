# About RVal

RVal is a minimalistic, transparent reactive programming library, heavily inspired by [MobX](http://mobx.js.org)[^1], 
with the same core principle: _Everything that can be derived from state, should be derived. Automatically_.

RVal enables you to organize state into **reactive values**, and provides utilities to **update** this state, **derive** from this state, and organize **side-effects** related to this state.

The core principles of RVal are:

* 🍭 **Minimalistic** A very simple, minimalistic core API
* 🛅 **Functions + stateful immutable objects**: Functions and (stateful) immutable objects as the primary means to organize state
* 🎯 **Convention driven**: An idiomatic way of working, that guides devs into the [Pit of Success](https://medium.com/@ricomariani/the-pit-of-success-cfefc6cb64c8)
* 📦 **Embeddable**: A low level building block, that is small (~2KB minified gzipped) so that it can easily be embedded in existing libraries and frameworks as state management library.
* 🐆 **Fast**: Rock solid performance, leveraging the battle tested algorithms of MobX.
* ☔ **Versatile**: no dependencies, no modern syntax or language requirements, non-intrusive, applicable in any ES5 JavaScript stack
* 🎓 **Gradual learning curve**: Opt-in utilities that help with applying best practices
* 💪 **Strongly typed**: Shouldn't need further explanation in 2019

Ok, that is a pretty vague, generic list of things that sound positive.
It boils down to this: RVal is small, conceptually simple and powerful.
Or, put differently: 

_The proof of the pudding is in the eating._.

Here are some terms that you will encounter when reading the introduction: 
It's all about _reactive values_ and _immutable stateful objects_. 
Read the introduction to find out what that abomination of seemingly conflicting concepts means.
But at least: you won't be needing `this`, `let`, `var` or `class`.
However, if you don't like messing around with functions, you'll better take refuge somewhere else.

[^1]: Compared to Mobx, the goals are slightly different and the library is in terms of API surface and bundle size _much_ smaller.
